            <h2>Summary</h2><br>
                <p>
                    I am a self-taught web developer equipped with significant
                    Python and web development skills, largely acquired from
                    educational bootcamps from App Brewery. I have hands-on
                    experience in responsive web design and full-stack development,
                    honed through a variety of personal projects and freelance
                    <br>
                    roles. I am adept at swiftly adapting to new scenarios and
                    technologies, forging effective web solutions for diverse
                    industries. My solid coding practices, alongside my ability
                    to assure customer satisfaction and deliver high-performing
                    web solutions, frame me as a dedicated and solid web developer.

            <h2>Education</h2><br>
                <p>
                    As a self-taught web developer, my educational journey
                    primarily involved completing Python and Web Development
                    bootcamps at the App Brewery. In these bootcamps, I gained
                    foundational Python programming skills and mastered the
                    creation of responsive websites and web apps using HTML,
                    CSS, JavaScript, and more. <br>
                    <br>

                    The Python bootcamp fortified my understanding of Python
                    syntax, data structures, built-in libraries, and other core
                    concepts. The Web Development bootcamp encompassed HTML, CSS,
                    Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node, Express.js and MongoDB.
                    Through consistent practice and hands-on projects, I
                    developed solid theoretical knowledge and practical skills
                    in web development, continuously staying updated with industry
                    trends and practices.

            <h2>Work Experience</h2><br>
                <p>
                    As an autonomous web developer, I honed my skills through a
                    portfolio of personal and freelance projects. This allowed
                    me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios and broaden
                    my practical understanding of web development.
                    In the capacity of a freelancer, I have worked with numerous
                    clients from diverse industries. This exposure required me to
                    adapt quickly to new environments and coding practices,
                    serving as an opportunity to expand my technical arsenal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My personal web development projects have mainly revolved
                    around creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications
                    using the skills acquired from my education. Each project
                    incorporated full-stack development tools, including Python
                    for back-end and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end.
                    These projects and experiences have molded me into a well-rounded
                    web developer capable of managing all aspects of web development
                    ranging from design, development, testing, to deployment.
                    My exposure to both personal work and client-driven tasks has
                    emphasized the importance of customer satisfaction and crafting
                    efficient, accessible, and high-performing web solutions.
